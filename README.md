# Dive into VR with WebGL & Three.js

Thank you for your interest in my tech talk!

## Check out my Three.js sandbox:

My Three.js sandbox, used during my talk to demonstrate features of Three.js, can be found [here](https://github.com/chaz303/Three.JS-Tech-Talk/tree/master/Sandbox). In order to use the sandbox yourself, please follow these instructions.

Enter the following commands:

* `git clone https://github.com/chaz303/Three.JS-Tech-Talk.git`
* `cd ./Three.JS-Tech-Talk/Sandbox/`
* `sudo npm install http-server -g`
* `http-server -c-1`

Once the server is running:

* Click on this link for the original sandbox: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* When the page has loaded: press the 'h' key for help.

* Click on this link for the **experimental** sandbox: [http://localhost:8080/index_2.html](http://localhost:8080/index_2.html)
* When the page has loaded: press the 'h' key for help.


## Here is the code along:

The files needed for the code along can be found here [code along folder](https://github.com/chaz303/Three.JS-Tech-Talk/tree/master/Code%20Along). You can download these files individually and open them with a browser manually, or you can use the following command-line instructions.

Enter the following commands:
* `git clone https://github.com/chaz303/Three.JS-Tech-Talk.git`
* `cd ./Three.JS-Tech-Talk/Code\ Along/`
* `google-chrome ./index-1.html` (for Chrome Browser)

**Note: pages (intentionally) appear blank except for `index-5.html` and `index-6.html`**

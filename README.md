# Dive into VR with WebGL & Three.js

Thank you for your interest in my tech talk. 

## Code Along

Download the 5 html files in the [code along folder](https://github.com/chaz303/Three.JS-Tech-Talk/tree/master/Code%20Along).

## My Three.js Sandbox

My Three.js sandbox used during my talk can be found [here](https://github.com/chaz303/Three.JS-Tech-Talk/tree/master/Sandbox). This code needs to be run on a local server in order to work.
* Run: npm install http-server -g
* Inside the "Sandbox" drectory, run: http-server -c-1
* Inside a web browser, open: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Once the page has loaded: press the 'h' key for help.
